9. Suppose you are working in a project where you need to do many random
memory accesses and binary search. Array vs Linked list which is more suitable
in this case? Why?

If i need to do many random memory accesses and binary search, an array is generally 
more suitable than a linked list.

because of this is that arrays provide constant-time random access to elements, while linked lists require
 linear time to access elements at arbitrary positions.

Binary search requires random access to elements, which means that it is much more efficient to perform it on 
an array than on a linked list. With an array, i can access any element in constant time by using its index.
 However, with a linked list, i need to traverse the list from the beginning each time i want to 
 access an element at a specific position, which takes linear time.

Therefore, if i need to perform many random memory accesses and binary search, an array would be a better
 choice than a linked list. However, if i frequently need to insert or delete elements from the middle of 
 the list, a linked list may be more appropriate.
