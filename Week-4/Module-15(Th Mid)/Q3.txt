The basic ide of binary search is array must be sorted and  we find the mid index value which is equal to target value.
If this value is less then target value then we ignor this value which is less than and equal mid index value.
If this value is gatter than target value than we ignor this value which is gatter than and equal mid value.
after complete the loop we will find the target value and this algorithm time complexity is O(logn).

In linear search is deffer because when find a value using this algorithm. this algorithm check all value is equal to 
target value or not if this value is last of the index then it will take so much time to get the target value.
commont different binary swach and binary search is: binary search is check all value to get target value but linear search
algorithm will check sequentilly to get target value.

The requirement for Array must be sorted otherwise it not working poperly.
