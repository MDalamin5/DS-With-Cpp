Arrays:
1. All index or node are list stored sequentilly.
2. An array all data are same tipe like if array integer type then all value is integer type.

LinkedList:
1. All index or node are not list stored sequentilly.
2. In LinkedList is collection of object known as node where node consists two or three part i.e., previus node address,
data , next node address.

Why do we need a head/root node in a linked list?

Head node is most importent becouse when we access linked list where node will come first and every node is 
connected like train so first node is head.
if we know the head then we can access full node or and node of linked list.
if we add value or delete value at taill then also need head. we go last node trough head.
if a link list don't have haed then it look like a human waithout head.
so head is the most import pointer of the linked list.
