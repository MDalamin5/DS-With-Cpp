1. What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of a singly linked list?
Answer: The time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of a singly linked list O(1).
because we just create new node and connected to the head no need any loop so time complexity is O(1).

2. What is the time complexity of inserting an element at any index of a singly linked list?
the time complexity of inserting an element at any index of a singly linked list worse case O(n).
because first we need to go before index node and connected to new node with this node so need a loop 
to this loop thats-why  the worse case time complexity is O(n).

3. What is the time complexity of deleting an element at the beginning of a singly linked list?
The time complexity of deleting an element at the beginning of a singly linked list O(1).
because we just delete head and head connecte to next node so time complexity is O(1).

4. What is the time complexity of deleting an element at any index of a singly linked list?
the time complexity of deleting an element at any index of a singly linked list worse case O(n).
because firstly, we need to go before node index and delete next index and connected next node with previus node so need a loop 
to this loop thats-why  the worse case time complexity is O(n).
