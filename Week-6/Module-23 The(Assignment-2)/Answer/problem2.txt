In stack push which add a new element in head or first index where a single opration so its time complexity
is O(1). Time complexity of pop opration also constant so its time complexity O(1) because stack work LIFO
method.
Time complexity of top opration also constant we just return or check which value has first index so
its a single opration and time complexity is O(1).
