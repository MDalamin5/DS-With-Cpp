If i want to random access in a stack value then array base stack implementation is batter because
Think in linked list base stack where one node connect with anoter node or one node carray anoter or
next or previous node address but that node can not contain after next five node address. Therefore, 
i want to access indext 4 node value then what have to do. I have to do liner travers it will take time
if the stack size is so bigger then it will take so much time. Now think array base stack in array every 
cell are stay sequectially so i know every index arrrss if i know array first cell address so it will take
less time if the stack size is bigger and it time complixity if constant opration which is O(1) where 
linked list base stack random access time complixity is O(n).
So, i can make the decitation if i want to random access  in stack then array base stack implementation
is so batter.
